The core idea is to provide the class <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardName</a> and <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardNameTable</a> with a minimal set of properties. A <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardName</a> at its core is a simple string value, based on specific construction rules defined by its (standard name) table.
By enriching numerical data with a <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardName</a>, complex information can be added by only using one attribute. An example of a such a name is "x_derivative_of_y_velocity". The name itself already suggests its meaning, however, a lookup in the respective standard name table would reveals the precise meaning (the name describes the derivative of the y-velocity w.r.t. the x-coordinate).

The rules of standard name construction is defined in a document associated with the <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardNameTable</a>. The table contains all standard names defied by a project or community. Instances of <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardName</a> and StandardNameTable can be used e.g. in combinations with other ontologies like <a href="https://nfdi4ing.pages.rwth-aachen.de/metadata4ing/metadata4ing/" target="_blank">metadata4ing</a> for a concise description of a numerical variable.

The below class diagram gives a quick overview of the central classes of the ontology. The ontology is still under development.

Standard names are intended to be used as attributes in HDF5 files or withing metadata describing a dcat:Dataset in general. To indicate which standard name table is used for the file a relation between the file and the standard name table can be established as shown below.
