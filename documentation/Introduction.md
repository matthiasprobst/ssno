The main focus of the ontology is to implement the concepts
of <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardNames</a>
and <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardNameTable">StandardNameTable</a> are defined. At its essence,
a <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardName</a> is a simple string value, constructed
according to specific rules outlined in its
associated <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardNameTable">StandardNameTable</a>.

By assigning a <a href="https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno#StandardName">StandardName</a> to numerical data, complex
information can be conveyed through a single attribute. An instance, a name like "x_derivative_of_y_velocity" gives an
intuitive sense of its meaning. A detailed lookup in the relevant standard name table clarifies the exact
interpretation, indicating, in this case, that the name represents the derivative of the y-velocity with respect to the
x-coordinate.
