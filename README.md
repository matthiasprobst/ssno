# sSNO - simple Standard Name Ontology

This repository contains the (draft) sSNO ontology. The ontology allows the usage of so-called "standard names", which
are originally introduced by the [cf-conventions](http://cfconventions.org/), but are in a more general sense applicable
to other research topics, too.

The ontology stored in the turtle file [ssno.ttl](ssno.ttl). A [Tutorial](Guide.md) helps with the first steps.

## Documentation

The documentation of the ontology is available [here](https://matthiasprobst.github.io/ssno/).
